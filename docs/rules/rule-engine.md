# Rule Engine

Enforce coding standards across your team automatically.

The Rule Engine allows you to define "Rules" (similiar to Roslyn Analyzers but simpler) using natural language or simple C# logic.

## Usage
1.  Go to **Tools > Unity AI CoPilot > Rules**.
2.  Enable specific rules (e.g., "No Public Fields", "Enforce Namespaces").
3.  The agent will check your code against these rules before committing or during scans.
